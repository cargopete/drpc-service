# dispatch-service

Runs on the indexer alongside an Ethereum node. Validates TAP receipts, proxies JSON-RPC requests, signs responses, and persists receipts to PostgreSQL.

## Request flow

```
Gateway POST /rpc/42161
  + TAP-Receipt: { signed EIP-712 receipt }
        │
        ▼
TAP middleware
  - recover signer from EIP-712 signature
  - check sender is in authorized_senders
  - check timestamp not stale (configurable window)
  - persist receipt to tap_receipts table (async)
        │
        ▼
Parse JSON-RPC method + params
        │
        ▼
Forward to backend Ethereum client (chain_id → backend URL mapping)
        │
        ▼
Sign response attestation:
  keccak256(chainId || method || paramsHash || responseHash || blockNumber || blockHash)
        │
        ▼
Return JSON-RPC response
  + X-Dispatch-Attestation: <signature>
```

## TAP receipt validation

The service validates every incoming receipt before forwarding the request:

- **Signature**: EIP-712 ECDSA recovery against `GraphTallyCollector` as verifying contract
- **Sender authorisation**: recovered signer must be in `authorized_senders` config list
- **Staleness**: `timestamp_ns` must be within the configured window
- **Data service**: `data_service` field must match `RPCDataService` address

Invalid receipts are rejected with `400 Bad Request`.

## Archive tier detection

The service inspects block parameters to determine if a request requires archive state:

- Hex block numbers below current head - 128 → routed to archive backend
- String tags `"earliest"`, `"pending"` → archive
- JSON integers → parsed and compared against head

This allows a single endpoint to serve both standard and archive requests when both backends are configured.
